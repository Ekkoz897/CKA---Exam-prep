Kubernetes (K8s) helps automate and manage containers at large scales.

- Automatic scaling: Kubernetes can increase or decrease the number of containers based on CPU or memory usage.

- It can deploy new versions of your app with zero downtime. Gradually replacing containers.

- Self-healing: If a container or node fails, Kubernetes restarts or reschedules it automatically.

- Simplified networking: Every service gets its own IP and DNS name — making container communication easy.

- Built-in monitoring & logging


WHEN SHOULD WE USE IT ?

Microservices architectures — when an app has many small services that need coordination.

Production systems — where uptime, load balancing, and monitoring are critical.

CI/CD pipelines — to automate testing and deployment of containerized apps.


WHEN SHOULDN'T WE USE IT ?

Running a small or single app — a single Docker container is enough.

Don’t need scaling — if the traffic is stable and predictable.

Limited resources or budget — K8s clusters need more compute and setup time.

Simple local projects or prototypes — Docker Compose is easier for development.
